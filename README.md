# LuaLander

A 2D lunar landing game built with Unity. Navigate your spacecraft through space and land safely on the moon's surface while managing your fuel supply!

## Features:

🚀 **Realistic Physics** - Feel the weight and momentum of your spacecraft as you navigate through space.

⛽ **Fuel Management** - Every thrust counts! Manage your limited fuel supply to reach the landing pad.

🎯 **Precision Landing** - Land softly and straight to get the highest score. Too fast or too tilted and it's game over!

💥 **Multiple Failure States** - Crash on terrain, land too hard, or come in at a steep angle - each mistake has consequences.

🏆 **Dynamic Scoring** - Your score depends on how perfectly you land - speed, angle, and landing zone all matter.

⚡ **Pickups & Bonuses** - Collect fuel pickups to extend your flight and grab coins for extra points.

🎮 **Simple Controls** - Arrow keys to fly: Up for thrust, Left and Right to rotate. Easy to learn, hard to master!

📱 **Play Anywhere** - Available on Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux.
